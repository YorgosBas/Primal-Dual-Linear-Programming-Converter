# Primal to Dual Linear Programming Converter

This repository extends [LP_Parser](https://github.com/YorgosBas/Linear-Program-Parser) functionallity with an additional feature of converting a primal problem to dual problem

## How to run
1. Install Parser.py and PrimalToDual.py
2. Write the file name to be converted in the same directory (Example: "Primal.txt")
3. Script will generate "dual.txt" file with the converted problem.

## How it works
1. Parses primal problem and checks for errors. Data are stored in specific matrices
2. Converts the primal problem to dual
